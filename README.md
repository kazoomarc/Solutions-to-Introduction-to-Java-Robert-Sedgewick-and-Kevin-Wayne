# Solutions-to-Introduction-to-Java-Robert-Sedgewick-and-Kevin-Wayne

This Repo is to **`SOME`**  of the solutions to the **`Creative Exercises`** and **`Exercises`** in the Book "`Introdution to Java : An interdiscplinary Approach`" by `Robert Sedgewick` and `Kevin Wayne`.

All exercises chosen from the  regular exercises will be in folder `<a.b> Exercises`

1. These are my approaches to the exercises and it is very possible that there are other better takes(Methods) to the exercises.
2. Some solutions are or will not be complete and where so i have added comments in the code itself how they can be completed. Some code will possibly have bugs, make sure to analyse it well, sorry in advance.

You can also provide feedback on where some code can be improved and/or on buggy code.

Thanks for your understanding.
