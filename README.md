# Solutions-to-Introduction-to-Java-Robert-Sedgewick-and-Kevin-Wayne

This Repo is to some of the solutions to the **Creative Exercises and Some chosen Exercises** in the Book "Introdution to Java : An interdiscplinary Approach" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

All exercises chosen from the  regular exercises will be in folder `<a.b> Selected Exercises`

1. These are my approach to the exercises and it is very possible that there are other better takes to the exercises.

2. Some solutions are or will not be complete and where so i have added comments in the code itself how they can be completed. Some code will possibly have bugs and i say sorry in advance.

You can also provide feedback on where some code can be changed to work well and/or avoid some errors.

Thanks for your uderstanding
